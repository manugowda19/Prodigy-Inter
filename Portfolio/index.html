                <p>Steven Paul "Steve" Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, investor and co-founder 
                    and CEO of Apple Inc. He was the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Pixar Animation Studios until it was bought by The Walt 
                    Disney Company. He was the largest shareholder at Disney and a member of Disney's Board of Directors. He was seen as a leading 
                    figure in both the computer and entertainment industries. In August 2011, Jobs resigned, and was appointed Chairman of Apple. 
                    He served in that position until he died, at the age of 56, on October 5, 2011 from complications of pancreatitis related to 
                    type 1 diabetes and metastatic insulinoma. Steve Jobs had type 1 diabetes as a child and had problems with insulin when he died.

                    Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption. 
                    His adoptive parents, Clara and Paul Jobs, lived in Mountain View. Jobs and his father would work on electronics in the 
                    family garage, and as a teen, Jobs spent his free time at Hewlett-Packard, where that he befriended computer club guru Steve 
                    Wozniak. After high school, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, but he dropped out after six months, though he later attended 
                    De Anza College over two semesters. Jobs and Wozniak conceived a series of user-friendly personal computers.

                Jobs was a Silicon Valley businessman. He was most famous for his work 
                with the company Apple Computer Inc, The company started with the release of 
                the Apple I in 1976.Together with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Jobs helped make the 
                idea of the personal computer popular in the late 1970s. In the early 1980s, while still 
                at Apple, Jobs was one of the first people to see the potential of using a mouse to control things on a computer screen.

                The knowledge that Woz gathered at the Homebrew meetings, as well as his exceptional talent, allowed him to 
                build his own computer board — simply because he wanted a personal computer for himself. Steve Jobs took interest, 
                and he quickly understood that his friend's brilliant invention could be sold to software hobbyists, who wanted to 
                write software without the hassle of assembling a computer kit. Jobs convinced Wozniak to start a company for that 
                purpose: Apple Computer was born on April 1, 1976.

            iPod made Steve Jobs realize that Apple could become the greatest consumer electronics company on the planet. 
            Around 2003, he started a secret project to develop a computer tablet. But in 2004-2005, he realized that the 
            technology that had been developed for this tablet —including a revolutionary touch-screen technology— could also 
            be used in a mobile phone, which was even more appealing. After two more years of development, iPhone was introduced at 
            Macworld on January 9, 2007. This keynote is often considered the pinnacle of Steve Jobs' career.

                In late 2003, he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer of a rare kind, that could potentially be cured by surgery. 
                However, against everyone's advice, he refused to have the surgery for nine long months. Instead, true to the ideals of 
                his youth, he tried alternative diets and treatments, including acupuncture and seeing a psychic. Only in July 2004 did 
                he agree to have the surgery. He looked healthy for the next five years, and spoke publicly of being 'cured' of cancer at 
                his famous Stanford commencement speech in 2005.
